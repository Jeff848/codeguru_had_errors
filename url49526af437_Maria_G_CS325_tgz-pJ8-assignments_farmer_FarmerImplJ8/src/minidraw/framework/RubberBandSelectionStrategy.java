/** A strategy for selecting figures when using the SelectAreaTracker.
 * You can implement a non-default strategy in order to control which
 * figures are selected when rubber band selecting. One example is in
 * board games where you may select a set of checkers but this strategy
 * can remove opponent checkers so a selection operation only select your own.
